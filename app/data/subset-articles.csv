1,10.1089/omi.2016.0041,"Quantile normalization, beta mixture quantile normalization","Despite an established link between sleep deprivation and epigenetic processes in humans, it remains unclear to what extent sleep deprivation modulates DNA methylation. We performed a within-subject randomized blinded study with 16 healthy subjects to examine the effect of one night of total sleep deprivation (TSD) on the genome-wide methylation profile in blood compared with that in normal sleep. Genome-wide differences in methylation between both conditions were assessed by applying a paired regression model that corrected for monocyte subpopulations. In addition, the correlations between the methylation of genes detected to be modulated by TSD and gene expression were examined in a separate, publicly available cohort of 10 healthy male donors (E-GEOD-49065). Sleep deprivation significantly affected the DNA methylation profile both independently and in dependency of shifts in monocyte composition. Our study detected differential methylation of 269 probes. Notably, one CpG site was located 69 bp upstream of ING5, which has been shown to be differentially expressed after sleep deprivation. Gene set enrichment analysis detected the Notch and Wnt signaling pathways to be enriched among the differentially methylated genes. These results provide evidence that total acute sleep deprivation alters the methylation profile in healthy human subjects. This is, to our knowledge, the first study that systematically investigated the impact of total acute sleep deprivation on genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in blood and related the epigenomic findings to the expression data.",,"Total sleep deprivation (TSD) significantly affected DNA methylation profile in blood in healthy human subjects both independently and with respect to monocyte composition, with one CpG site (69 bp upsteam of ING5) being differentially expressed after sleep deprivation. Notch and Wnt signaling pathways were also enhanced among the differentially methylated genes.",

Since DNA methylation plays a critical role in the regulation of gene expression, studies of differentially methylated positions (DMPs) might be valuable for understanding the mechanisms underlying insomnia. We performed a cross-sectional genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation in relation to self-reported insufficient sleep in individuals from a community-based sample (79 men, aged 39.3 ± 7.3), and in relation to shift work disorder in an occupational cohort (26 men, aged 44.9 ± 9.0). The analysis of DNA methylation data revealed that genes corresponding to selected DMPs form a distinctive pathway: “Nervous System Development” (FDR P value < 0.05). We found that 78% of the DMPs were hypomethylated in cases in both cohorts, suggesting that insufficient sleep may be associated with loss of DNA methylation. A karyoplot revealed clusters of DMPs at various chromosomal regions, including 12 DMPs on chromosome 17, previously associated with Smith-Magenis syndrome, a rare condition comprising disturbed sleep and inverse circadian rhythm. Our findings give novel insights into the DNA methylation patterns associated with sleep loss, possibly modifying processes related to neuroplasticity and neurodegeneration. Future prospective studies are needed to confirm the observed associations.",,"In both cohorts (self-reported insufficient sleep in a community-based cohort and shift work disorder in an occupational cohort), 78% of the differentially methlated positions (DMPs) were hypomethylated, suggesting that insufficient sleep may be associated with loss of DNA methylation.",
3,10.1371/journal.pone.0228958,,"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a syndrome leading to chronic intermittent hypoxia, and the up-regulation of toll-like receptors (TLR) 2 and 6 on peripheral blood cells has been reported. We hypothesized that DNA methylation in TLR2 and TLR6 genes may play a role in the development of OSA and its excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) phenotype. DNA methylation over 28 cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites of the TLR2 promoter region and 3 CpG sites of the TLR6 gene body, and their protein expressions were measured by using pyrosequencing and ELISA methods in 18 heathy subjects (HS) and 58 patients with severe OSA (divided into 18 non-EDS and 40 EDS group). Patients with severe OSA had higher DNA methylation levels over five CpG sites (#1, #2, #3, #25 and #28) and lower DNA methylation levels over CpG site #18 of the TLR2 promoter region, higher DNA methylation levels over two CpG sites (#1 and #3) of the TLR6 gene body, and higher protein expressions of TLR6 than HS. The CpG site #2 of the TLR6 gene body was hypermethylated in severe OSA patients with EDS. Both DNA methylation levels over CpG site #1 of the TLR6 gene body and protein expressions of TLR6 were reduced after more than 6 months of nasal CPAP treatment in seven selected patients. Aberrant DNA methylation of the TLR2 promoter region and TLR6 gene body are associated with the consequence of severe OSA and its EDS phenotype.",,"Patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) had higher DNA methylation levels over five CpG sites (#1, #2, #3, #25 and #28) and lower DNA methylation levels over CpG site #18 of the TLR2 promoter region, higher DNA methylation levels over two CpG sites (#1 and #3) of the TLR6 gene body, and higher protein expressions of TLR6 than healthy subjects.

4,10.1186/s12944-016-0309-1,,"Sleep deprivation has been associated with obesity among adults, and accumulating data suggests that stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) expression has a relevant impact on fatty acid (FA) composition of lipid pools and obesity. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of one-night total sleep deprivation (TSD) on DNA methylation in the 5’-prime region of SCD1, and whether detected changes in DNA methylation are associated with SCD activity indices (product to precursor FA ratios; 16:1n-7/16:0 and 18:1n-9/18:0) derived from serum phospholipids (PL).",,"Three CpG sites close to the transcription start site (TSS) of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) (cg00954566, cg24503796, cg14089512) were significantly differentially methylated in dependency of sleep duration. Both SCD-16 and SCD-18 activity indices increased after one-night TSD and were associated with DNA methylation changes of the three CpG sites above.",
