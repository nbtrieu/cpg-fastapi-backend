We performed a within-subject randomized blinded study with 16 healthy subjects to examine the effect of one night of total sleep deprivation (TSD) on the genome-wide methylation profile in blood compared with that in normal sleep. Genome-wide differences in methylation between both conditions were assessed by applying a paired regression model that corrected for monocyte subpopulations. In addition, the correlations between the methylation of genes detected to be modulated by TSD and gene expression were examined in a separate, publicly available cohort of 10 healthy male donors (E-GEOD-49065). Sleep deprivation significantly affected the DNA methylation profile both independently and in dependency of shifts in monocyte composition. Our study detected differential methylation of 269 probes. Notably, one CpG site was located 69 bp upstream of ING5, which has been shown to be differentially expressed after sleep deprivation. Gene set enrichment analysis detected the Notch and Wnt signaling pathways to be enriched among the differentially methylated genes. These results provide evidence that total acute sleep deprivation alters the methylation profile in healthy human subjects. This is, to our knowledge, the first study that systematically investigated the impact of total acute sleep deprivation on genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in blood and related the epigenomic findings to the expression data.",,"Total sleep deprivation (TSD) significantly affected DNA methylation profile in blood in healthy human subjects both independently and with respect to monocyte composition, with one CpG site (69 bp upsteam of ING5) being differentially expressed after sleep deprivation.

These pathways are involved in a variety of cellular processes, including development, differentiation, and proliferation. The study's findings suggest that sleep deprivation may have epigenetic effects that could contribute to the development of chronic diseases.

Since DNA methylation plays a critical role in the regulation of gene expression, studies of differentially methylated positions (DMPs) might be valuable for understanding the mechanisms underlying insomnia. We performed a cross-sectional genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation in relation to self-reported insufficient sleep in individuals from a community-based sample (79 men, aged 39.3 ± 7.3), and in relation to shift work disorder in an occupational cohort (26 men, aged 44.9 ± 9.0). The analysis of DNA methylation data revealed that genes corresponding to selected DMPs form a distinctive pathway: “Nervous System Development” (FDR P value < 0.05). We found that 78% of the DMPs were hypomethylated in cases in both cohorts, suggesting that insufficient sleep may be associated with loss of DNA methylation. A karyoplot revealed clusters of DMPs at various chromosomal regions, including 12 DMPs on chromosome 17, previously associated with Smith-Magenis syndrome, a rare condition comprising disturbed sleep and inverse circadian rhythm. Our findings give novel insights into the DNA methylation patterns associated with sleep loss, possibly modifying processes related to neuroplasticity and neurodegeneration.

We hypothesized that DNA methylation patterns may contribute to disease severity or the development of hypertension and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

Methods
Illumina's (San Diego, CA, USA) DNA methylation 27-K assay was used to identify differentially methylated loci (DML). DNA methylation levels were validated by pyrosequencing. A discovery cohort of 15 patients with OSA and 6 healthy subjects, and a validation cohort of 72 patients with sleep disordered breathing (SDB).

Results
Microarray analysis identified 636 DMLs in patients with OSA versus healthy subjects, and 327 DMLs in patients with OSA and hypertension versus those without hypertension. In the validation cohort, no significant difference in DNA methylation levels of six selected genes was found between the primary snoring subjects and OSA patients (primary outcome). However, a secondary outcome analysis showed that interleukin-1 receptor 2 (IL1R2) promoter methylation (−114 cytosine followed by guanine dinucleotide sequence [CpG] site) was decreased and IL1R2 protein levels were increased in the patients with SDB with an oxygen desaturation index > 30. Androgen receptor (AR) promoter methylation (−531 CpG site) and AR protein levels were both increased in the patients with SDB with an oxygen desaturation index > 30. Natriuretic peptide receptor 2 (NPR2) promoter methylation (−608/−618 CpG sites) were decreased, whereas levels of both NPR2 and serum C type natriuretic peptide protein were increased in the SDB patients with EDS. Speckled protein 140 (SP140) promoter methylation (−194 CpG site) was increased, and SP140 protein levels were decreased in the patients with SDB and EDS.

Conclusions
IL1R2 hypomethylation and AR hypermethylation may constitute an important determinant of disease severity, whereas NPR2 hypomethylation and SP140 hypermethylation may provide a biomarker for vulnerability to EDS in OSA.

This is the first study to perform a large-scale DNA methylation analysis with replication of the principal finding in OSA patients. The identification of the abnormal DNA methylation marks in OSA provides novel biomarkers for prediction and diagnosis, and affords novel therapeutic targets for the prevention of adverse consequences of OSA.

However, evidence is just budding on the effects of aerobic exercise-induced adaptation on DNA methylation in older mild cognitively impaired (MCI) elderly African American (AAs). Therefore, we examined the effects of a 6-month aerobic exercise-intervention on genome-wide DNA methylation in elderly AA MCI volunteers.

Design: Elderly AA volunteers confirmed MCI assigned into a 6-month program of aerobic exercise (eleven participants) underwent a 40-min supervised-training 3-times/week and controls (eight participants) performed stretch training. Participants had maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) test and Genome-wide methylation levels at CpG sites using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip assay at baseline and after a 6-month exercise program. We computed false discovery rates (FDR) using Sidak to account for multiplicity of tests and performed quantitative real-time polymerase chain-reaction (qRT-PCR) to confirm the effects of DNA methylations on expression levels of the top 5 genes among the aerobic participants. CpG sites identified from aerobic-exercise participants were similarly analyzed by the stretch group to quantify the effects of exercise-induced methylation changes among the group of stretch participants.

Results: Eleven MCI participants (aerobic: 73% females; mean age 72.3 ± 6.6 years) and eight MCI participants (stretch: 75% female; mean age 70.6 ± 6.7 years) completed the training. Aerobic exercise-training was associated with increases in VO2max and with global hypo- and hypermethylation changes. The most notable finding was CpG hypomethylation within the body of the VPS52 gene (P = 5.4 × 10-26), a Golgi-associated protein, involved in intracellular protein trafficking including amyloid precursor protein. qRT-PCR confirmed a nearly twofold increased expression of VPS52.

Here we determined the beneficial epigenetic effects of exercise after sprint interval training, a form of exercise known to improve cardiometabolic health. We quantified genome-wide leukocyte DNA methylation of 12 healthy young (18–24 yr) men before and after 4 wk (thrice weekly) of sprint interval training using the 450K BeadChip (Illumina) and validated gene expression changes in an extra seven subjects. Exercise increased subjects' cardiorespiratory fitness and maximal running performance, and decreased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration in conjunction with genome-wide DNA methylation changes. Notably, many CpG island and gene promoter regions were demethylated after exercise, indicating increased genome-wide transcriptional changes. Among genes with DNA methylation changes, epidermal growth factor (EGF), a ligand of the epidermal growth factor receptor known to be involved in cardiovascular disease, was demethylated and showed decreased mRNA expression. Additionally, we found that in microRNAs miR-21 and miR-210, gene DNA methylation was altered by exercise causing a cascade effect on the expression of the mature microRNA involved in cardiovascular function. Our findings demonstrate that exercise alters DNA methylation in circulating blood cells in microRNA and protein-coding genes associated with cardiovascular physiology.

Exercise training can prevent and attenuate symptoms of cardiometabolic diseases such as insulin resistance, elevated blood pressure (BP), excess adiposity, and vascular impairment (18). The precise molecular mechanisms underpinning the health benefits gained from regular exercise training, however, are not known. DNA methylation affected by environmental factors modulates gene expression and may therefore mediate the health benefits gained from exercise training (19).

Recently, individuals involved in a 6-mo moderate-intensity exercise training program displayed genome-wide skeletal myocyte and adipocyte DNA methylation changes in genes associated with type 2 diabetes (49, 55). Additionally, older adult leukocyte DNA methylation increased in the proinflammatory PYCARD gene after 6 mo of aerobic exercise training to levels observed in their middle-aged peers (47). Although 6 mo of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise modulates the DNA methylome, it is unknown whether shorter training regimes affect DNA methylation. Moreover, although leukocytes are known to contribute to vascular disease (58), it is not known whether exercise is an environmental factor that regulates the leukocyte methylome and, in turn, contributes to improved vascular health.

Given that the effects of acute exercise on DNA methylation are intensity-dependent (5), we aimed to determine whether leukocyte DNA methylation changes occur after short-term (4 wk), yet intense exercise training. We used sprint interval training as a form of exercise training because it rapidly improves vascular functioning (53, 54), insulin sensitivity (3), cardiorespiratory function, and physical performance [reviewed in (25, 57)]. We aimed to 1) identify the effects of 4 wk of thrice weekly exercise on genome-wide leukocyte DNA methylation in healthy young men; 2) establish whether specific DNA methylation changes occurred reciprocally with altered gene expression; and 3) identify the acute effect of maximal exercise on genes and microRNAs (miRNAs) related to cardiovascular disease.

Obesity is a major health problem that is determined by interactions between lifestyle and environmental and genetic factors. Although associations between several genetic variants and body-mass index (BMI) have been identified, little is known about epigenetic changes related to BMI. We undertook a genome-wide analysis of methylation at CpG sites in relation to BMI.

Methods
479 individuals of European origin recruited by the Cardiogenics Consortium formed our discovery cohort. We typed their whole-blood DNA with the Infinium HumanMethylation450 array. After quality control, methylation levels were tested for association with BMI. Methylation sites showing an association with BMI at a false discovery rate q value of 0·05 or less were taken forward for replication in a cohort of 339 unrelated white patients of northern European origin from the MARTHA cohort. Sites that remained significant in this primary replication cohort were tested in a second replication cohort of 1789 white patients of European origin from the KORA cohort. We examined whether methylation levels at identified sites also showed an association with BMI in DNA from adipose tissue (n=635) and skin (n=395) obtained from white female individuals participating in the MuTHER study. Finally, we examined the association of methylation at BMI-associated sites with genetic variants and with gene expression.

Findings
20 individuals from the discovery cohort were excluded from analyses after quality-control checks, leaving 459 participants. After adjustment for covariates, we identified an association (q value ≤0·05) between methylation at five probes across three different genes and BMI. The associations with three of these probes—cg22891070, cg27146050, and cg16672562, all of which are in intron 1 of HIF3A—were confirmed in both the primary and second replication cohorts. For every 0·1 increase in methylation β value at cg22891070, BMI was 3·6% (95% CI 2·4–4·9) higher in the discovery cohort, 2·7% (1·2–4·2) higher in the primary replication cohort, and 0·8% (0·2–1·4) higher in the second replication cohort. For the MuTHER cohort, methylation at cg22891070 was associated with BMI in adipose tissue (p=1·72 × 10−5) but not in skin (p=0·882). We observed a significant inverse correlation (p=0·005) between methylation at cg22891070 and expression of one HIF3A gene-expression probe in adipose tissue. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms—rs8102595 and rs3826795—had independent associations with methylation at cg22891070 in all cohorts. However, these single nucleotide polymorphisms were not significantly associated with BMI.

Interpretation
Increased BMI in adults of European origin is associated with increased methylation at the HIF3A locus in blood cells and in adipose tissue. Our findings suggest that perturbation of hypoxia inducible transcription factor pathways could have an important role in the response to increased weight in people.

The molecular mechanisms underlying the potential health benefits of a ketogenic diet are unknown and could be mediated by epigenetic mechanisms.

Objective
To identify the changes in the obesity-related methylome that are mediated by the induced weight loss or are dependent on ketosis in subjects with obesity underwent a very-low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD).

Methods
Twenty-one patients with obesity (n = 12 women, 47.9 ± 1.02 yr, 33.0 ± 0.2 kg/m2) after 6 months on a VLCKD and 12 normal weight volunteers (n = 6 women, 50.3 ± 6.2 yrs, 22.7 ± 1.5 kg/m2) were studied. Data from the Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip methylomes of blood leukocytes were obtained at time points of ketotic phases (basal, maximum ketosis, and out of ketosis) during VLCKD (n = 10) and at baseline in volunteers (n = 12). Results were further validated by pyrosequencing in representative cohort of patients on a VLCKD (n = 18) and correlated with gene expression.

Results
After weight reduction by VLCKD, differences were found at 988 CpG sites (786 unique genes). The VLCKD altered methylation levels in patients with obesity had high resemblance with those from normal weight volunteers and was concomitant with a downregulation of DNA methyltransferases (DNMT)1, 3a and 3b. Most of the encoded genes were involved in metabolic processes, protein metabolism, and muscle, organ, and skeletal system development. Novel genes representing the top scoring associated events were identified, including ZNF331, FGFRL1 (VLCKD-induced weight loss) and CBFA2T3, C3orf38, JSRP1, and LRFN4 (VLCKD-induced ketosis). Interestingly, ZNF331 and FGFRL1 were validated in an independent cohort and inversely correlated with gene expression.

DNA methylation patterns associated with habitual diet have not been well studied.

Methods:
Diet quality was characterized using a Mediterranean-style diet score and the Alternative Healthy Eating Index score. We conducted ethnicity-specific and trans-ethnic epigenome-wide association analyses for diet quality and leukocyte-derived DNA methylation at over 400 000 CpGs (cytosine-guanine dinucleotides) in 5 population-based cohorts including 6662 European ancestry, 2702 African ancestry, and 360 Hispanic ancestry participants. For diet-associated CpGs identified in epigenome-wide analyses, we conducted Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to examine their relations to cardiovascular disease risk factors and examined their longitudinal associations with all-cause mortality.

Results:
We identified 30 CpGs associated with either Mediterranean-style diet score or Alternative Healthy Eating Index, or both, in European ancestry participants. Among these CpGs, 12 CpGs were significantly associated with all-cause mortality (Bonferroni corrected P<1.6×10−3). Hypermethylation of cg18181703 (SOCS3) was associated with higher scores of both Mediterranean-style diet score and Alternative Healthy Eating Index and lower risk for all-cause mortality (P=5.7×10−15). Ten additional diet-associated CpGs were nominally associated with all-cause mortality (P<0.05).

One of the major challenges in obesity treatment is to explain the high variability in the individual’s response to specific dietary and physical activity interventions. With this study, we tested the hypothesis that specific DNA methylation changes reflect individual responsiveness to lifestyle intervention and may serve as epigenetic predictors for a successful weight-loss.

Methods
We conducted an explorative genome-wide DNA methylation analysis in blood samples from 120 subjects (90% men, mean ± SD age = 49 ± 9 years, body mass-index (BMI) = 30.2 ± 3.3 kg/m2) from the 18-month CENTRAL randomized controlled trial who underwent either Mediterranean/low-carbohydrate or low-fat diet with or without physical activity.

Results
Analyses comparing male subjects with the most prominent body weight-loss (responders, mean weight change − 16%) vs. non-responders (+ 2.4%) (N = 10 each) revealed significant variation in DNA methylation of several genes including LRRC27, CRISP2, and SLFN12 (all adj. P < 1 × 10−5). Gene ontology analysis indicated that biological processes such as cell adhesion and molecular functions such as calcium ion binding could have an important role in determining the success of interventional therapies in obesity. Epigenome-wide association for relative weight-loss (%) identified 15 CpGs being negatively correlated with weight change after intervention (all combined P < 1 × 10− 4) including new and also known obesity candidates such as NUDT3 and NCOR2. A baseline DNA methylation score better predicted successful weight-loss [area under the curve (AUC) receiver operating characteristic (ROC) = 0.95–1.0] than predictors such as age and BMI (AUC ROC = 0.56).

Conclusions
Body weight-loss following 18-month lifestyle intervention is associated with specific methylation signatures.

Epigenetic mechanisms may play an important role in the aetiology of type 2 diabetes. Recent epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs) identified several DNA methylation markers associated with type 2 diabetes, fasting glucose and HbA1c levels. Here we present a systematic review of these studies and attempt to replicate the CpG sites (CpGs) with the most significant associations from these EWASs in a case–control sample of the Lifelines study.

Methods
We performed a systematic literature search in PubMed and EMBASE for EWASs to test the association between DNA methylation and type 2 diabetes and/or glycaemic traits and reviewed the search results. For replication purposes we selected 100 unique CpGs identified in peripheral blood, pancreas, adipose tissue and liver from 15 EWASs, using study-specific Bonferroni-corrected significance thresholds. Methylation data (Illumina 450K array) in whole blood from 100 type 2 diabetic individuals and 100 control individuals from the Lifelines study were available. Multivariate linear models were used to examine the associations of the specific CpGs with type 2 diabetes and glycaemic traits.

Results
From the 52 CpGs identified in blood and selected for replication, 15 CpGs showed nominally significant associations with type 2 diabetes in the Lifelines sample (p < 0.05). The results for five CpGs (in ABCG1, LOXL2, TXNIP, SLC1A5 and SREBF1) remained significant after a stringent multiple-testing correction (changes in methylation from −3% up to 3.6%, p < 0.0009). All associations were directionally consistent with the original EWAS results. None of the selected CpGs from the tissue-specific EWASs were replicated in our methylation data from whole blood.

Epigenetic mechanisms related to changes in DNA methylation (DNAm), may also contribute to T2D risk, but larger studies are required to discover novel markers, and to confirm existing ones.

Results
We performed a large meta-analysis of individual epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of prevalent T2D conducted in four European studies using peripheral blood DNAm.

We found three novel CpGs associated with prevalent T2D in Europeans at cg00144180 (HDAC4), cg16765088 (near SYNM) and cg24704287 (near MIR23A) and confirmed three CpGs previously identified (mapping to TXNIP, ABCG1 and CPT1A). We also identified 77 T2D associated DMRs, most of them hypomethylated in T2D cases versus controls.

We estimated that these six CpGs captured 11% of the variation in T2D, which was similar to the variation explained by the model including only the common risk factors of BMI, sex, age and smoking (R2 = 10.6%).

This nested case–control study was based upon an early pregnancy follow-up cohort (ChiCTR1900020652). Target CpG sites were extracted from related published literature and bioinformatics analysis. The DNA methylation levels at 337 CpG sites of 80 GDM cases and 80 matched healthy controls during the early pregnancy (10–15 weeks) were assessed using MethylTarget sequencing. The best cut-off level for methylation of CpG site was determined using the generated ROC curve. The independent effect of CpG site methylation status on GDM was analyzed using conditional logistic regression. Methylation levels at 6 CpG sites were significantly higher in the GDM group than in controls, whereas those at another 6 CpG sites were significantly lower (FDR < 0.05). The area under the ROC curve at each methylation level of the significant CpG sites ranged between 0.593 and 0.650 for the occurrence of GDM. After adjusting for possible confounders, the hypermethylation status of CpG site 68167324 (OR = 3.168, 1.038–9.666) and 24837915 (OR = 5.232, 1.659–16.506) was identified as more strongly associated with GDM; meanwhile, the hypermethylation of CpG site 157130156 (OR = 0.361, 0.135–0.966) and 89438648 (OR = 0.206, 0.065–0.655) might indicate lower risk of GDM. The methylation status of target CpG sites in the peripheral blood of pregnant women during the first trimester may be associated with GDM pathogenesis, and has potential as a predictor of GDM.",,"During early pregnancy, researchers analyzed DNA methylation levels at 337 CpG sites to determine any correlation with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).

Chronic low-grade inflammation reflects a subclinical immune response implicated in the pathogenesis of complex diseases. Identifying genetic loci where DNA methylation is associated with chronic low-grade inflammation may reveal novel pathways or therapeutic targets for inflammation.

Results
We performed a meta-analysis of epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of serum C-reactive protein (CRP), which is a sensitive marker of low-grade inflammation, in a large European population (n = 8863) and trans-ethnic replication in African Americans (n = 4111). We found differential methylation at 218 CpG sites to be associated with CRP (P < 1.15 × 10–7) in the discovery panel of European ancestry and replicated (P < 2.29 × 10–4) 58 CpG sites (45 unique loci) among African Americans. To further characterize the molecular and clinical relevance of the findings, we examined the association with gene expression, genetic sequence variants, and clinical outcomes. DNA methylation at nine (16%) CpG sites was associated with whole blood gene expression in cis (P < 8.47 × 10–5), ten (17%) CpG sites were associated with a nearby genetic variant (P < 2.50 × 10–3), and 51 (88%) were also associated with at least one related cardiometabolic entity (P < 9.58 × 10–5). An additive weighted score of replicated CpG sites accounted for up to 6% inter-individual variation (R2) of age-adjusted and sex-adjusted CRP, independent of known CRP-related genetic variants.

Conclusion

Methods At baseline, participants (n = 521) were cognitively normal, around 73 years of age (mean 72.4, SD 0.716), and had inflammation, vascular risk (cardiovascular disease history, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, alcohol consumption, body mass index), and neuroimaging (structural and diffusion MRI) data available. Baseline inflammatory status was quantified by a traditional measure of peripheral inflammation—serum C-reactive protein (CRP)—and an epigenetic measure (DNA methylation [DNAm] signature of CRP). Linear models were used to examine the inflammation–brain health associations; mediation analyses were performed to interrogate the relationship between chronic inflammation, brain structure, and cognitive functioning.

Results We demonstrate that DNAm CRP shows significantly (on average 6.4-fold) stronger associations with brain health outcomes than serum CRP. DNAm CRP is associated with total brain volume (β = −0.197, 95% confidence interval [CI] −0.28 to −0.12, pFDR = 8.42 × 10−6), gray matter volume (β = −0.200, 95% CI −0.28 to −0.12, pFDR = 1.66 × 10−5), and white matter volume (β = −0.150, 95% CI −0.23 to −0.07, pFDR = 0.001) and regional brain atrophy. We also find that DNAm CRP has an inverse association with global and domain-specific (speed, visuospatial, and memory) cognitive functioning and that brain structure partially mediates this CRP–cognitive association (up to 29.7%), dependent on lifestyle and health factors.

Discussion These results support the hypothesis that chronic inflammation may contribute to neurodegenerative brain changes that underlie differences in cognitive ability in later life and highlight the potential of DNAm proxies for indexing chronic inflammatory status.

Meanwhile, Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) has demonstrated favourable effects on cardiovascular risk, blood pressure, inflammation and other complications related to excessive adiposity. Some of these effects could be mediated by epigenetic modifications. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate whether the adherence to MedDiet is associated with changes in the methylation status from peripheral blood cells. A subset of 36 individuals was selected within the Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea (PREDIMED)-Navarra study, a randomised, controlled, parallel trial with three groups of intervention in high cardiovascular risk volunteers, two with a MedDiet and one low-fat control group.

Crohn's disease is a relapsing and remitting inflammatory disorder with a variable clinical course. Although most patients present with an inflammatory phenotype (B1), approximately 20% of patients rapidly progress to complicated disease, which includes stricturing (B2), within 5 years. We analyzed DNA methylation patterns in blood samples of pediatric patients with Crohn's disease at diagnosis and later time points to identify changes that associate with and might contribute to disease development and progression.

Methods
We obtained blood samples from 164 pediatric patients (1–17 years old) with Crohn's disease (B1 or B2) who participated in a North American study and were followed for 5 years. Participants without intestinal inflammation or symptoms served as controls (n = 74). DNA methylation patterns were analyzed in samples collected at time of diagnosis and 1–3 years later at approximately 850,000 sites. We used genetic association and the concept of Mendelian randomization to identify changes in DNA methylation patterns that might contribute to the development of or result from Crohn's disease.

Results
We identified 1189 5′-cytosine–phosphate–guanosine-3′ (CpG) sites that were differentially methylated between patients with Crohn's disease (at diagnosis) and controls. Methylation changes at these sites correlated with plasma levels of C-reactive protein. A comparison of methylation profiles of DNA collected at diagnosis of Crohn's disease vs during the follow-up period showed that, during treatment, alterations identified in methylation profiles at the time of diagnosis of Crohn's disease more closely resembled patterns observed in controls, irrespective of disease progression to B2. We identified methylation changes at 3 CpG sites that might contribute to the development of Crohn's disease. Most CpG methylation changes associated with Crohn's disease disappeared with treatment of inflammation and might be a result of Crohn's disease.

Conclusions
Methylation patterns observed in blood samples from patients with Crohn's disease accompany acute inflammation; with treatment, these change to resemble methylation patterns observed in patients without intestinal inflammation. These findings indicate that Crohn's disease–associated patterns of DNA methylation observed in blood samples are a result of the inflammatory features of the disease and are less likely to contribute to disease development or progression.",,"In a study analyzing DNA methylation patterns in pediatric Crohn's disease patients, 1189 differentially methylated 5′-cytosine–phosphate–guanosine-3′ (CpG) sites were identified between patients at diagnosis and controls.

The interindividual variable response to weight-loss treatments requires the search for new predictive biomarkers for improving the success of weight-loss programs.

Methods
Subjects from Metabolic Syndrome Reduction in Navarra (RESMENA) project were classified as low (LR) or high (HR) responders depending on their weight loss. Transcriptomic (n = 24) and epigenomic (n = 47) patterns were determined by array-based genome-wide technologies in human white blood cells at the baseline of the treatment period. CD44 expression was validated by qRT-PCR and methylation degree of CpGs of the gene was validated by MassARRAY® EpiTYPER™ in a subsample of 47 subjects. CD44 protein levels were measured by ELISA in human plasma.

Results
Different expression and DNA methylation profiles were identified in LR in comparison to HR. The integrative analysis of both array data identified four genes: CD44, ITPR1, MTSS1 and FBXW5 that were differently methylated and expressed between groups. CD44 showed higher expression and lower DNA methylation levels in LR than in HR. Although differences in CD44 protein levels between LR and HR were not statistically significant, a positive association was observed between CD44 mRNA expression and protein levels.

It is well-established that cancer treatment substantially increases the risk of long-term adverse health outcomes among childhood cancer survivors.

To elucidate the pathophysiology and a possible causal pathway from treatment exposures to cardiometabolic conditions, we conducted epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) to identify the DNA methylation (DNAm) sites associated with cancer treatment exposures and examined whether treatment-associated DNAm sites mediate associations between specific treatments and cardiometabolic conditions.

Methods
We included 2052 survivors (median age 33.7 years) of European ancestry from the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study, a retrospective hospital-based study with prospective clinical follow-up. Cumulative doses of chemotherapy and region-specific radiation were abstracted from medical records. Seven cardiometabolic conditions were clinically assessed.

The development of lung cancer results from the interaction between genetic mutations and dynamic epigenetic alterations, although the exact mechanisms are not completely understood. Changes in DNA methylation may be a promising biomarker for early detection and prognosis of lung cancer. We evaluated the serial changes in genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in blood samples of lung cancer patients.

Methods: 
Blood samples were obtained for three consecutive years from three patients (2 years before, 1 year before, and after lung cancer detection) and from three control subjects (without lung cancer). We used the MethylationEPIC BeadChip method, which covers the 850,000 bp cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) site, to conduct an epigenome-wide analysis. Significant differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified using p-values <0.05 in a correlation test identifying serial methylation changes and serial increase or decrease in β value above 0.1 for three consecutive years.

Results: 
We found three significant CpG sites with differentially methylated β values and 7,105 CpG sites with significant correlation from control patients without lung cancer. However, there were no significant DMRs. In contrast, we found 11 significant CpG sites with differentially methylated β values and 10,562 CpG sites with significant correlation from patients with lung cancer.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) results from a complex interplay between genetics and the environment. Several epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) have found DNA methylation loci associated with T2D in European populations. However, data from African populations are lacking. We undertook the first EWAS for T2D among sub-Saharan Africans, aiming at identifying ubiquitous and novel DNA methylation loci associated with T2D.

Methods
The Illumina 450k DNA-methylation array was used on whole blood samples of 713 Ghanaian participants (256 with T2D, 457 controls) from the cross-sectional Research on Obesity and Diabetes among African Migrants (RODAM) study. Differentially methylated positions (DMPs) for T2D and HbA1c were identified through linear regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, estimated cell counts, hybridization batch, array position and body mass index (BMI). We also did a candidate analysis of previously reported EWAS loci for T2D in non-African populations, identified through a systematic literature search.

Results
Four DMPs [cg19693031 (TXNIP), cg04816311 (C7orf50), cg00574958 (CPT1A), cg07988171 (TPM4)] were associated with T2D after correction for inflation by possible systematic biases.

Methods We performed a systematic literature search in PubMed and EMBASE for EWASs to test the association be- tween DNA methylation and type 2 diabetes and/or glycaemic traits and reviewed the search results. For replication purposes we selected 100 unique CpGs identified in peripheral blood, pancreas, adipose tissue and liver from 15 EWASs, using study-specific Bonferroni-corrected significance thresholds. Methylation data (Illumina 450K array) in whole blood from 100 type 2 diabetic individuals and 100 control individuals from the Lifelines study were available. Multivariate linear models were used to examine the associations of the specific CpGs with type 2 diabetes and glycaemic traits.

Results From the 52 CpGs identified in blood and selected for replication, 15 CpGs showed nominally significant associa- tions with type 2 diabetes in the Lifelines sample (p < 0.05). The results for five CpGs (in ABCG1, LOXL2, TXNIP, SLC1A5 and SREBF1) remained significant after a stringent multiple-testing correction (changes in methylation from −3% up to 3.6%, p < 0.0009).

The prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity has dramatically increased within a few generations, reaching epidemic levels. In addition to genetic risk factors, epigenetic mechanisms triggered by changing environment are investigated for their role in the pathogenesis of these complex diseases. Epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs) have revealed significant associations of T2D, obesity, and BMI with DNA methylation. However, populations from the Middle East, where T2D and obesity rates are highest worldwide, have not been investigated so far.

Methods
We performed the first EWAS in an Arab population with T2D and BMI and attempted to replicate 47 EWAS associations previously reported in Caucasians. We used the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip to quantify DNA methylation in whole blood DNA from 123 subjects of 15 multigenerational families from Qatar. To investigate the effect of differing genetic background and environment on the epigenetic associations, we further assessed the effect of replicated loci in 810 twins from UK.

All the associations were further confirmed in the UK cohort for both BMI and T2D. Meta-analysis increased the significance of the observed associations and revealed strong heterogeneity of the effect sizes (apart from CPT1A), although associations at these loci showed concordant direction in the two populations.

Conclusions
Our study replicated eight known CpG associations with T2D or BMI in an Arab population.

Indian Asians, who make up a quarter of the world's population, are at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes. We investigated whether DNA methylation is associated with future type 2 diabetes incidence in Indian Asians and whether differences in methylation patterns between Indian Asians and Europeans are associated with, and could be used to predict, differences in the magnitude of risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

Methods
We did a nested case-control study of DNA methylation in Indian Asians and Europeans with incident type 2 diabetes who were identified from the 8-year follow-up of 25 372 participants in the London Life Sciences Prospective Population (LOLIPOP) study. Patients were recruited between May 1, 2002, and Sept 12, 2008. We did epigenome-wide association analysis using samples from Indian Asians with incident type 2 diabetes and age-matched and sex-matched Indian Asian controls, followed by replication testing of top-ranking signals in Europeans. For both discovery and replication, DNA methylation was measured in the baseline blood sample, which was collected before the onset of type 2 diabetes. Epigenome-wide significance was set at p<1 × 10−7. We compared methylation levels between Indian Asian and European controls without type 2 diabetes at baseline to estimate the potential contribution of DNA methylation to increased risk of future type 2 diabetes incidence among Indian Asians.

Findings
1608 (11·9%) of 13 535 Indian Asians and 306 (4·3%) of 7066 Europeans developed type 2 diabetes over a mean of 8·5 years (SD 1·8) of follow-up. The age-adjusted and sex-adjusted incidence of type 2 diabetes was 3·1 times (95% CI 2·8–3·6; p<0·0001) higher among Indian Asians than among Europeans, and remained 2·5 times (2·1–2·9; p<0·0001) higher after adjustment for adiposity, physical activity, family history of type 2 diabetes, and baseline glycaemic measures. The mean absolute difference in methylation level between type 2 diabetes cases and controls ranged from 0·5% (SD 0·1) to 1·1% (0·2). Methylation markers at five loci were associated with future type 2 diabetes incidence; the relative risk per 1% increase in methylation was 1·09 (95% CI 1·07–1·11; p=1·3 × 10−17) for ABCG1, 0·94 (0·92–0·95; p=4·2 × 10−11) for PHOSPHO1, 0·94 (0·92–0·96; p=1·4 × 10−9) for SOCS3, 1·07 (1·04–1·09; p=2·1 × 10−10) for SREBF1, and 0·92 (0·90–0·94; p=1·2 × 10−17) for TXNIP. A methylation score combining results for the five loci was associated with future type 2 diabetes incidence (relative risk quartile 4 vs quartile 1 3·51, 95% CI 2·79–4·42; p=1·3 × 10−26), and was independent of established risk factors.

Associations between DNA methylation and incident type 2 diabetes were examined using robust linear regression with adjustment for potential confounders. Inverse-variance fixed-effects meta-analysis of cohort-level individual CpG EWAS estimates was performed using METAL. The methylGSA R package was used for gene set enrichment analysis. Confirmation of genome-wide significant CpG sites was performed in a cohort of Indian Asians (LOLIPOP, UK).

Results
The meta-analysis identified 76 CpG sites that were differentially methylated in individuals with incident type 2 diabetes compared with control individuals (p values <1.1 × 10−7). Sixty-four out of 76 (84.2%) CpG sites were confirmed by directionally consistent effects and p values <0.05 in an independent cohort of Indian Asians. However, on adjustment for baseline BMI only four CpG sites remained genome-wide significant, and addition of the 76 CpG methylation risk score to a prediction model including established predictors of type 2 diabetes (age, sex, BMI and HbA1c) showed no improvement (AUC 0.757 vs 0.753). Gene set enrichment analysis of the full epigenome-wide results clearly showed enrichment of processes linked to insulin signalling, lipid homeostasis and inflammation.

Conclusions/interpretation
By combining results from five European cohorts, and thus significantly increasing study sample size, we identified 76 CpG sites associated with incident type 2 diabetes. Replication of 64 CpGs in an independent cohort of Indian Asians suggests that the association between DNA methylation levels and incident type 2 diabetes is robust and independent of ethnicity. Our data also indicate that BMI partly explains the association between DNA methylation and incident type 2 diabetes. Further studies are required to elucidate the underlying biological mechanisms and to determine potential causal roles of the differentially methylated CpG sites in type 2 diabetes development.","Biomarkers, DNA methylation, Epigenetics, Epigenome-wide association studies, Meta-analysis, Prediction, Prospective studies, Type 2 diabetes","In a meta-analysis of epigenome-wide association studies from five European cohorts, researchers identified 76 CpG sites associated with incident type 2 diabetes.
